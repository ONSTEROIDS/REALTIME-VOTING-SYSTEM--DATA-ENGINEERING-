# REALTIME-VOTING-SYSTEM--DATA-ENGINEERING-
BUILDING A REATIME VOTING SYSTEM AN END TO END DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT



A real-time voting system leverages modern data engineering tools to ensure fast and reliable vote processing. It uses Docker for containerized deployment, ensuring scalability and consistency across environments. Apache Kafka streams votes in real time, while Apache Spark processes and analyzes the data for instant insights. A user-friendly Streamlit interface visualizes live voting trends, and Python powers the integration of all components for seamless operation.
